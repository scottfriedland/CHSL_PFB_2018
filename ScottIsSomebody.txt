Scott by Shel Silverstein

Scott loves me,
Scott cares,
Scott picks me peaches and pears.
Scott offers me candy and Cokes,
Scott listens and laughs at me jokes.
Scott helps when I get in a fight,
Scott does all my homework at night.
Scott misses me,
Scott cries,
Scott thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Scott is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Scott just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Scott's hand,
In the darkness where Scott usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Scott's gone!
